# SCREENS : Video controlling App

## Description
App to display multiple videos on different devices all controlled from a single device.  Videos need to be able to either be looped, run in sequence, or triggered.  Each device needs to have a seperate set of videos picked from a master list.  Controller needs to know what is playing on each device at any time.

## High level Architecture
Next JS app hosted on Vercel.
Controller and Displays need to be browser based.
Each display should have its own unique URL to "log on" to.

## Dev rules
Application should be well architected, developed, tested, and documented to exacting standards.
